    Path extracting mixin.

    It is often necessary to test responses in json format, or mixed dictionary/list/user-defined-object/et blobs
    validating specific entries, in various response paths. Use the ``extract_path()`` helper to access such
    entries while at the same time validating path expectations. Extract values at different paths from a
    mixed dict/list/user-obj blob:

        example_nested_blob = [
            True, False, {
                'anything_1': ('a', 'b', 'c'),
                'instance': SomeUserDefinedClass(
                    name='Fred',
                    age=32,
                    children={
                        'Bob': 3,
                        'Alice': 5,
                    }
                ),
                'anything_2': 66
            }, None,
        ]

        assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(1).is_equal_to(False)
        assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'anything_1').is_length(3).extract_path(1).is_equal_to('b')
        assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'anything_2').is_equal_to(66)
        assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'instance', 'name').is_equal_to('Fred')
        assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'instance', 'children').has_Bob(3).has_Alice(5)
    """
    def extract_path(self, *keys):

        element at final layer.

        Args:
            *keys: the keys forming the path to extraction.

        Examples:
            Usage::
                example_nested_blob = [
                    True, False, {
                        'anything_1': ('a', 'b', 'c'),
                        'instance': SomeUserDefinedClass(
                            name='Fred',
                            age=32,
                            children={
                                'Bob': 3,
                                'Alice': 5,
                            }
                        ),
                        'anything_2': 66
                    }, None,
                ]

                assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(1).is_equal_to(False)
                assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'anything_2').is_equal_to(66)
                assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'instance', 'name').is_equal_to('Fred')
                assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'instance', 'children').has_Bob(3).has_Alice(5)

            Works with list/tuple/range, dict-like & user-object types.

            Allows chaining extractions while doing validations along the path::

                assert_that(example_nested_blob).extract_path(2, 'anything_1').is_length(3).extract_path(1).is_equal_to('b')

        Returns:
            AssertionBuilder: returns a new instance (now with the extracted element as the val) to chain to the next assertion

        Raises:
            AssertionError: if any of the given keys representing path is **not** index, key or attribute of the corresponding val layer
